## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Top Matter

Note the top of this page. It is delineated with 3 dashes. This is known as the **Top Matter**. Minimally, it will populate with the title and author and format upon first creation.

In this area, you can also control document properties. For example, you can add a Table of Contents, you can change fonts, address formatting, etc.

## Adding Text

The beauty of Markdown is the ability to write to text AND code. This writing is done with the help of a Markdown language. I provide a cheatsheet online + there are TONS of resources online.

### Some basics

You can make a

## Second Level

### Third Level

## Emphasis

*italics* **bold**

## Unordered list

-   I
-   am
-   a
    -   list

## Order List

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three

-   Half
-   

## Paragraphs

Here is a paragraph.

Here is another one. (Note the space.)

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## A million other things...

-   Math code

$\mu = mx+b$

-   Underline

[This is underlined]{.underline}

-   Color

[this word is goldenrod]{style="color:goldenrod;"}

-   Tables

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

## Have Fun

We will be using quarto files (qmd + html files) all semester. You will be asked to turn in your files in these formats.
