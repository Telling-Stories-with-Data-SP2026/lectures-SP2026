## Reproducibility

> Reproducibility is obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis.

# Step 1: Writing (and getting) Results

## Markdown Languages

<center>
A format that combines code, results, and commentary into a single file
</center>

**Markup files are designed for:**

-   Communicating to those who want to focus on the conclusions and not the code (advisers, clients, me)

-   Collaborating with other data data scientists who are interested in the conclusions [and]{.underline} the code (your peers)

-   Used as a modern day lab notebook where you can document 1) what you did, 2) what you were thinking, and 3) how you got there.

## Version Control

We've all been here...

## Git vs. Github

- Git allows us to keep track of different versions of file(s)
- Github is a website where we can upload and monitor these tracked changes.

1. You will all have a complete Git workflow
    + Please send username to me.
2. We will have a class Git organization
3. You will each have weekly repositories. I will upload these the weekend before. 
4. You will each clone repos from Github.
    + This will create an Rproject (.rproj)
    + This goes into a folder on your machine.
    + My advice, have a 'mother' folder, and a weekly folder
5. Each week you may have notes (.r file), quarto files (qmd/html), or others. Each day you will commit and push any changes.
    + Pull every class just in case anything may have changed online. Then continue... make commits... push... repeat
6. All files will be turned in, in this manner.
