### What does this mean?

![](chart.png){width="50%"}

## R vs. RStudio

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### R

**R** is a programming language.

*   Your computer operates on a series of 0/1s
*   R is the translator between you and the computer
*   Object oriented programming language

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Rstudio

**Rstudio** is an integrated developmental environment (IDE)

*   "Automatic transmission" of the R programming language
*   Lightweight interface
*   Aesthetically pleasing and user friendly

## Why R?

## Packages in R

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**R** is a **functional** programming language.

\

A **function** is a self-contained block of code that accomplishes a specific task

\

**Functions** are bundled within **packages**

## Some Technical Notes

:::{style="font-size: 70%;"}

**R is case sensitive...**

\

**x** is not the same as **X**.


**my_variable** is not the same as **My_Variable**. 


**sum()** is not the same as **SUM()**. 

\

***but R is communicative***

:::

```{r}
#| error: true
#| echo: true
anthro <- "is_awesome"
anthr
```

\

[**Always check spelling first (and syntax)...**]{style="color:red;"}

## Object Names

::: {.columns}
::: {.column style = "width: 50%; font-size: 60%;"}

Everything is stored in R as an **Object**

```{r}
#| echo: true

anthro <- "rocks"
```

**Object names should:**

1.  Start with a letter

2.  Be descriptive, concise, and meaningful


\

**General naming conventions:**

*   Snake case: obj_name

*   Camel case: ObjName

*   Periods: obj.name

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## The Assignment Operator

\

The **assignment operator [<-]** is used to [assign values to objects]{.underline}.
The following lines of code are read as “___ gets the value of ___”.

\

::: {.columns}
::: {.column style = "width: 50%; font-size: 60%;"}

```{r}
#| echo: true

x <- 42
y <- 5

x + y
```

|           | **Windows** | **Mac** |
|-----------|:------------|------------|
| Shortcut  | Alt + -     | Option + - |

## PSA: Anticlimatic

After assigning a value to an object, R does not automatically show it in your console. It **does** populate in the [Environment Pane]. Double check your object exists by typing the name of the object or checking the **local environment.** Note, it must exist locally to be used in other observations. 

```{r}
#| echo: true

fabulous <- "pot sherds"
fabulous
```


## Common Problems

\

Quotation marks and parentheses must come in pairs!

\

R will "tell you" with a [+] sign...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

x <- "hello
+
+
+
```

**Solution:** Press [Esc] to cancel that line of code and start again.

## Getting Help

*   The `?` followed by some function or object name searches specific documentation. This is the same as the function `help()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
?sum
help(sum)
```

*   The `??` followed by some word or phrase is a broader search function and searches all documentation in memory. This is shorthand for `help.search()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
??"linear model"
help.search("linear model")
```

## Tidyverse Style Guide

Canyoureadthissentence?

*   After function names, do not leave a space

*   Before and after operator (+, -, <-, *, /), leave a space

*   Put a space after a comma, not before

*   Use consistent style --> whatever that may be...

## Begin a New Atomic Habit


1.  Open RStudio and type “Good morning, R” into the console. That’s it. Seriously.

2.  Write code for 5 minutes

3.  Use one new function. Reading the help page counts.

4.  Make a single commit on git.

5.  Be mundane.
